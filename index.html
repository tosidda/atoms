<h2 id="Elements">Elements</h2>
<p>Elements make up everything in the universe including you. You are made up of 4 elements CHON (cool video) which are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. Elements are substances that are madeup of one type of atom. There are 118 elements that have been dicovered. But only 94 of the elements exist in earth. Even though things can be made of the same element they can still be different materials based on how tightly the atoms fit together. For example, the element carbon can be diamond, or coal because the atoms fit differently for diamond and coal. All the elements are sorted out in a chart called The Periodic Table which was created by Dmitri Mendeleev.
<h2 id="Molecules">Molecules</h2>
<p>Molecules are two types of atoms bonded together. For example, water is made up of H20. H20 is a molecule because it is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Another way to think about molecules is like this. In a language you have letters. When you combine letters you make words. In other words, the laguange is the element, the words are the molecules, and the letters are the atoms. There are three ways atoms can bond to make molecules. Those three ways are ionic bonding, covalent bonding, and metallic bonding.
<h2 id="Atoms">Atoms</h2>
<p>Atoms are the basic structure of matter and they make up of the elements. Atoms are made up of three particles which are neutrons, protrons, and electrons. Atoms were created during the Big Bang which was about 13.7 bllion years ago. Atoms are the smallest things in the world. There are about seven billion billion billion atoms in the human body. Atoms can bond in three different ways which are ionic bonding, covalent bonding, and mettalic bonding. Ionic bonding means on atom gives their extra electron to another atom. Covalent bonding means atoms share their electrons. Mettalic bonding only happens with metal when they share their metal ions.

<h2 id="SmallerParticles">Smaller Particles</h2>

<p> Did you ever wonder if there are particles smaller then neutrons, protrons, and electrons? Well there are! These particles are called quarks. Quarks are inside neutrons, protrons, and electron. Ouarks were discovered on the year of 1964 by Murray Gell-Mann. There are actually 6 types of quarks: up, down, top, bottom, charm, and strange. There are also neutrino which are formed by nuclear reactions. Neutrinos are like electrons but they don't have any charge. Neutrinos travel almost as fast as the speed of light.
<h2 id ="FunFacts">Fun Facts</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li>The word atom comes from the word ATOMOS which means in
    isble.</li>
<li>Atoms are so small that some people say they can't be cut in half.</li>
<li>The most abudant type of atom is the hydrogen atom. About 74% of the atoms of the Milky Way are hydrogen atoms.</li>
<li>Hydrogen is the first element to ever be discovered in the perodic table.
